# How to Contribute

We welcome all contributions to OpenIdeas! :smile:

## Simple Rules

* Whenever you work on a new feature, create a branch for it based off of `master`. Name the branch with your name and the feature title (e.g. `jay_site-header`).

* When you've worked on a feature, and think it's ready to be put into the main codebase, create a GitHub pull request for your branch into `master`.

* If you started work on your feature a while back, it may have gotten far behind the HEAD of `master`. If this happens, use `git pull --rebase` to do a rebased pull so that your work doesn't create a bunch of unnecessary merges.

* You can't push to `master` unless you're a repository admin. All code changes will go through GitHub PRs.
