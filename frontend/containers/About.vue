  h2 About
  p ðŸ’¡#[strong  OpenIdeas] is a software project from the Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board (USB) at Purdue University.

  h5 About USB
  p The Computer Science Undergraduate Student Board (USB) exists to represent the concerns of Computer Science undergraduate students and to connect the students, the department, and our corporate parters. Some of our most successful endeavours include CS 193, Help Room, and (now its own organiation) Boilermake.

  h5 History
  p OpenIdeas was created in Spring 2018 by then-seniors #[a(href="http://mat.services") Matt Ess] and #[a(href="https://jayhankins.me") Jay Hankins]. USB saw the need to collect ideas for improving our CS community, and we thought there was no better application of our computer science educations than to create an app to solve this problem.

  h5 Special Thanks
  p We'd like to extend a special thanks to our advisors, Buster Dunsmore and Doug Comer. With their support, both educational and moral, we are empowered to represent our community, and that is a total honor.

  h5 Get Involved
  p Getting involved with OpenIdeas is easy. We welcome #[a(href="https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/openideas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md") contributions] to our GitHub #[a(href="https://github.com/Purdue-CSUSB/openideas") repository].
